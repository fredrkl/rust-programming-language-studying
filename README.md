Following the Rust Book, available at <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/>.

## Lessons learned

### Setup

When setting up the rust-analyzer and having my projects in a projects folder I needed to add another Cargo.toml file in the root, next to the projects folder. This file should contain the list of all the projects in the folder I want the rust-analyzer to be able to find.
